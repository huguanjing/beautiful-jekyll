**A**graphia **A**nonymous is an informal lab meeting that serves the dual purposes, as a writers' support group and as a journal club. The idea is that journal article reading and academic writing (reports, manuscripts, proposal, etc.) should go hand in hand. 

It was inpired by "The Agraphia Model" for promoting productive academic writing, as introduced in the book [How to Write a Lot](https://www.apa.org/pubs/books/4441031) by Paul J. Silvia, PhD ([Douban book review](https://book.douban.com/subject/2486955/)). 

Meeting schedule and articles are posted below along with the date.
