## About me

I am currently an Assistant Scientist working with [Dr. Jonathan Wendel](http://www.eeob.iastate.edu/faculty/WendelJ/) in the Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/). **My research focuses on evolutionary genetics of polyploidization and phenotypic evolution in plants, specifically using the cotton genus *Gossypium* as a model system**. Since 2006, I have been a PhD student (till 2013) and then Postdoc researcher (till 2018) in the same group under the supervision of Dr. Jonathan Wendel. My [PhD dissertation](http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/etd/13415/) work was to understand proteomic consequences of genome doubling, to describe cotton proteomes from the standpoint of polyploid fiber development and domestication, and to identify key proteins associated with and therefore possibly responsible for phenotypic changes and important traits relevant to crop improvement.

As an evolutionary biologist, I am broadly interested in the forces, patterns and processes that shape plant forms and functions. More specifically, I ask questions regarding the common yet mysterious phenomenon of polyploidization, how the whole-genome duplication of genes and their patterns of expression can be molded by natural and artificial selection, what aspects of genetic and developmental networks are most pliable, and ultimately how genotypes mold phenotypes. **My current research employs functional genomics and epigenomic approaches to study duplicated gene networks in allopolyploid cotton, aiming to illustrate how the "redundant" sets of gene network interact with each other to regulate developmental dynamics, respond to abiotic stresses and drive morphological diversity**.
