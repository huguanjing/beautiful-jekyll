## Co-expression gene network of cottonseed development

To gain insight into phenotypic diversification in cotton seeds, we conducted co-expression network analysis of developing seeds from diploid and allopolyploid cotton species and explored network properties.

Two different conceptual approaches were explored to help understand network conservation and divergence at various evolutionary timescales and across ploidy levels..

#### Approach One: construct a multispecies coexpression network to provide a global view of coexpression network topology among species, followed by identifying key modules associated with devlopmental dynamics and phenotypic diversification

#### Approach Two: construct individual coexpression networks for comparison to reveal topological changes in response to evolutionary events

## Homoeolog gene co-expression network implicates biased recruitment of regulatory architecture of seed development  
Instead of using the aggregated expression of homoeolog gene pairs, we now constructed allopolyploid co-expression networks based on homoeolog-specific expressions. This approach allows direct comparisons of sub-genome networks against their corresponding diploid parental networks. In addition to revealing topological modificantions of the "redundant" duplicated seed network following allopolyploidization, this work aims to explore the assymetric evolution of parental regulatory connections underlying phenotypic evolution and domestication.

Stay tuned!
