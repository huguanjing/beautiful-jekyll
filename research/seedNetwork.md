Cotton is best known as an important source of textile fibers; however, cotton seeds also provides vegetable oil and proteins, accounting for 10-15% of its total crop values. During the course of seed development in domesticated form of *Gossypium hirsutum* (TM1), oil content accumulates rapidly from 20 day to 30 days after flowering, and reaches approximately 25% of total seed weight. This profile is more similar to its D-genome than A-genome progenitor. Variance can also be seen from wild and domesticated species. **To gain insight into phenotypic diversification in cotton seeds, we conducted co-expression network analysis of developing seeds from diploid and allopolyploid cotton species and explored network properties.** Two different conceptual approaches were explored to help
understand gene coexpression network conservation and divergence at various evolutionary timescales and across ploidy levels. First, a multispecies coexpression network was constructed to provide a global view of coexpression network topology among species. Second, individual coexpression networks were constructed and compared for all species included in the study.

### Compare individual species networks to reveal topological changes in response to evolutionary events

We compared species-specific networks to reveal topological changes, including rewired edges and differentially coexpressed genes, associated with speciation, polyploidy, and cotton domestication. Network comparisons among species indicate that topologies are altered in addition to gene expression profiles, indicating that changes in transcriptomic coexpression relationships play a role in the developmental architecture of cotton seed development. The global network topology of allopolyploids, especially fordomesticatedG. hirsutum, resembles the network of
the A-genome diploid more than that of the D-genome parent, despite its D-like phenotype in oil content. Expression modifications
associated with allopolyploidy include coexpression leveldominance and transgressive expression, suggesting that the transcriptomic
architecture in polyploids is to some extent a modular combination of that of its progenitor genomes. Among allopolyploids,
intermodular relationships are more preserved between two different wild allopolyploid species than they are between wild and
domesticated forms of a cultivated cotton, and regulatory connections of oil synthesis-related pathways are denser andmore closely
clustered in domesticated vs. wild G. hirsutum. These results demonstrate substantial modification of genic coexpression under
domestication. Our work demonstrates how network inference informs our understanding of the transcriptomic architecture of
phenotypic variation associated with temporal scales ranging from thousands (domestication) tomillions (speciation) of years, and by
polyploidy.
