My research projects make use of the cotton genus *Gossypium* as a model system to investigate the immediate and long-term consequences of polyploidization in plants at the cellular and molecular level.

## Research area and approaches

Specific research areas currently include (1) the evolutionary dynamics of duplicated gene regulatory networks that underlies cotton seed and fiber development and morphological diversity, and (2) the chromatin structure of allopolyploid cotton and how it regulates abiotic stress responses and environmental adaptation. 

Experimental approaches include classical genetics and molecular biology, functional genomics, and bioinformatics.
