Compared to academic writing in LaTex, Markdown appears to be a less intimidating choice to me, considering that I have got some experences with Github README files and there is a page of "Markdown Cheat Sheet" lying in the corner of my desktop. So I was like, Hey, this is the solution to keep me focused on WRITING, not FORMATING! Hmmmmmmmm, the problem is that I am supposed to be writing this afternoon, BUT, I am now distracted to learn EVERTHING about **how to write in markdown**. Good job, me.

This [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpAJMSS8pvs&t=57s) by Nicholas Cifuentes-Goodbody was quite helpful to get me through the basics of how writing in markdown look like. So I decided to watch the rest of his video while working on one of my draft manuscript at the same time. Frankly, it was not a fluent process of learning followed by practicing, because of my limited patience and constant distractions by various fancy tools. But here is an orgainized list of resources and How-To for my own record and future reference. 

## Programs
* [Marked2](http://marked2app.com) - convert plain text to other documents (including HTML, PDF and Word) in a wide range of styles. 
* [TableFlip](http://tableflipapp.com) - edit markdown tables similiar as excel spreadsheat in place

## Q&A

### What text editor should I use to write my markdown files? 
**TextEdit** comes pre-installed in Mac OS, which opens a new document in rich text mode by default. To work in plain text mode, go to **Format > Make Plain Text** in the menu bar, or use the keyboard shortcut **Shift-Command-T**. Other coding editors like BBEdit, TextWrangler, Xcode, etc work too.

### How to make tables?
Creating tables in Markdown is straightforward, but aligning cells with tons of  `|` and `-` really sucks! **TableFlip** seems to be a useful tool but it cost $18.99... seriously? Marked2 was only $13.99! I will stick to this online table generator (http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) until I am getting really desperate.
