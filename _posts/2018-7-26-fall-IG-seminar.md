title: Getting ready to attend the IG graduate workshop in genetics 
tags: [seminar; epigenomics]

The memory of attending an [IG genetics workshop](https://www.genetics.iastate.edu/workshop-genet-591) six seven years ago, as a IG student of course, is still vivid: small group discussion of assigned papers, seminar followed by chalk talk, and lunch included! This invitation last November for me to give a talk in its 2018 fall course really caught me by surprise. The workshop topic this year is "Epigenetics and Epitranscriptomics: How do DNA and RNA modifications affect gene expression, development, and disease?". As a postdoc still working on my [cotton epigenomic project](/research/nucleosomeEvo), without any published work on this topic yet, my presentation will by no means provide students that kind of well established system as those workshop seminars I attended before (like back in 2007 when Prof Jiming Jiang told us about plant centrometer)! It turned out my two labmates who just attended the 2017 workshop nominated me to the organizer, and the invitation stills even after I explained the ongoing status of  my project. So, guess what, the IG students this fall will get to hear about how chromatin landscapes (more specifically, nucleosome organization) impact on duplicated gene regulation in allopolyploid cotton. I know I will will surely enjoy this experience, while defintely endure the pressure not to drag down the overall quality of the course... :)
