NSF grant submitted! The by-product manuscript submitted to bioRxiv and MBE! The last two months have been heck a journey, chaotic, exausting, painful, while so amazingly fruitful. 

I finally acquired some hands-on experience on writing a real grant proposal, from start to the end! It was so not limited to presenting the science and new ideas, and writing skills. The exta work was beyong my imagination: preparing various supplemental documents, studying policy of the grant agency, locating resources and assistance, going through the university administrative process, communications and soliciting reviews and suport. I really knew nothing before, but now feel so fourtunate to know something about this crazy world!
