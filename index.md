## Briefly about me

I am currently a postdoc researcher working with Dr. [Jonathan Wendel](http://www.eeob.iastate.edu/faculty/WendelJ/) in the Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/). **My work focuses on evolutionary genetics of polyploidization and phenotypic evolution in plants, specifically using the cotton genus *Gossypium* as a model system**. Between 2006 and 2013, I was a PhD student in the same group underder the supervision of Dr. Jonathan Wendel. My [PhD disseration](http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/etd/13415/) work was to understand proteomic consequences of genome doubling, to describe cotton proteomes from the standpoint of polyploid fiber development and domestication, and to identify key prteins associated with and therefore possibly responsible for phenotypic changes and important traits relevant to crop improvement.

As an evolutionary biologist, I am broadly interested the forces, patterns and processes that shape plant forms and functions. More specifically, I am facinated by the mysterious and common phenomenon of polyploidization, seeking to understand how the whole-genome duplication of genes and their patterns of expression can be molded by natural and artificial selection, what aspects of genetic and developmental networks are most pliable, and ultimately how genotypes mold phenotypes. My current research employs functional genomics and epigenomics approaches to study duplicated gene networks in allopolyploid cotton, aiming to illustrate how the "redundant" sets of gene network interact with each other to regulate developmental dynamics, respond to abiotic stresses and drive morphological diversity.
